## An exprimental website to explore colors

[![License](documentation/prototype.png)]

Programming is hard, but a lot of fun to learn. To me it really depends what you want to do with it. As a graphic designer I care a lot about tools for designers and this is my second attempt of creating a "browsable color picker" for the web. To make it harder for me I am using the Python programming language (in which I'm a total noob) - This is my first output on the main route ("/") loading my template with the Flask framework and rendering 100 ``<div>`` tags with random colors. My next step is to create a restful api with each color as a route & clickable link to a single page with value and brightness tables of the same given color. Wish me luck. ðŸ¤“â˜•
